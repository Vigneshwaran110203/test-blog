In today's interconnected world, [Secure Shell (SSH)](/iot/ssh-secure-shell) is fundamental to [secure remote access](/iot-remote-access).  

SSH password based authentication is vulnerable to attacks and generally not recommended for production usecases. 

[SSH Public Private key based authentication](/iot/configure-setup-ssh-public-keys-right-way/) is a secure and recommended method for production usecases.

But managing SSH keys across a growing infrastructure can be a nightmare. 

SocketXP simplifies this complexity, offering a robust SSH Key Management Solution that empowers you to control, automate, and secure your SSH access.

SocketXP is a cloud based SSH Key Management Solution that provides a centralized key management and control for all compute resources in your organization - both physical and virtual machines.

## The SSH Key Challenge: Beyond Simple Authentication 

SSH keys are stronger than passwords, but they introduce management overhead. SocketXP directly addresses these challenges:

### Key Sprawl

SocketXP provides a centralized inventory of all your SSH keys, giving you a clear view of who has access to what. No more hunting through disparate systems!

### Lifecycle Management

SocketXP automates the entire key lifecycle, from generation and distribution to rotation and revocation. Say goodbye to manual, error-prone processes.

### Access Control

With granular, role-based access control (RBAC), SocketXP makes it easy to define who can access which systems, enforcing least privilege and minimizing risk.

### Auditing and Compliance

SocketXP maintains detailed audit logs of all key-related activity, simplifying compliance demonstrations and security investigations.

### Security Risks

SocketXP securely stores and protects your private keys, safeguarding them against unauthorized access and theft.  

SocketXP creates and distributes a short-lived single-use SSH public key to your host machines.  

SSH public keys are deleted immediately after a user login.  Everytime, a user tries to make a new SSH connection, a new short-lived SSH public key will be distribution to the host computer.

## SocketXP: Your All-in-One SSH Key Management Platform

SocketXP offers a comprehensive suite of features to simplify and secure your SSH key management:

### Centralized Inventory

SocketXP provides a single pane of glass for managing all your SSH keys.  Quickly see key owners, associated systems, and access levels.

### Automated Key Provisioning

Streamline user onboarding and system access with automated key generation, distribution, and deployment.

### Lifecycle Management

Automate key rotation and revocation to maintain security best practices and minimize the window of vulnerability.

### Granular Access Control

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce least privilege and ensure only authorized personnel can access critical resources.

### Auditing and Logging

Maintain comprehensive audit trails of all key-related activities for compliance and security investigations.

### Key Storage and Protection

Securely store and protect your private keys using robust encryption mechanisms.

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

SocketXP integrates seamlessly with your existing IT systems, including identity providers (IdPs) and cloud platforms, through APIs and integrations.

### User-Friendly Interface

SocketXP offers an intuitive interface for administrators and users, simplifying key management and system access.

## How SocketXP Key Management Solution Works

By default, SocketXP Web Portal will create and sync a very short-lived single-use SSH public key to your Ubuntu Linux machine, so that you can securely remote login to your Ubuntu Linux from anywhere in the world, without having to use password based authentication. The key will be cleaned up or trashed immediately after the user logs in.

Note that a user can SSH into your host machine from the SocketXP web portal, only after a successful SSO login (and 2FA authentication) provided by your SSO OAuth provider such as: Microsoft 365 or Google G-Suite.

SocketXP has a built-in SSH public key management tool, that automates SSH public key management or syncing it between your Linux machine and the SSH web client. It even cleans up the key immediately, so that a new public key setup is required for the next login attempt by the same user.

For better security, you can even disable password based authentication completely on your Linux SSH server. But, if you prefer to use password based authentication, then select the “Password authentication” option during the login prompt in the SocketXP Web Portal. The default option is “SSH Public Key Authentication.”

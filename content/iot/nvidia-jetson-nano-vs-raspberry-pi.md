Single-board computers (SBCs) are becoming increasingly popular for their low cost and versatility. 

Two of the most popular SBCs are the Nvidia Jetson Nano and the Raspberry Pi. 

While both boards have their own strengths and weaknesses, they are often compared against each other due to their similar form factor and price point.

In this article, we'll discuss in great detail about each board, their benefits, limitations,  advantages, disadvantages, and the kind of projects for which they are suitable for.

Why wait?  Let's jump straight in and compare one with the other.

## What is Nvidia Jetson Nano
The Jetson Nano is a single-board computer designed specifically for AI applications. 

It is much more performant than a Raspberry Pi and is powered by a 1.4-GHz quad-core ARM A57 CPU, 128-core Nvidia Maxwell GPU and 4 GB of RAM. 

It has four USB type-A ports, including one that is USB 3.0, both HDMI and DisplayPort out for video and a gigabit Ethernet connector.

The Jetson Nano is your best choice if you’re looking for an AI-based single-board computer.

## What is Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a compact pocket-sized single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation from the UK. It can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing, programminng, games and it can also play high definition video. 

The most popular board specifications are:

### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B: 
Here are some of the features of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B:

-   1.5GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 CPU, 
-   2GB/4GB/8GB RAM options, 
-   dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, 
-   Bluetooth 5.0/BLE, 
-   Gigabit Ethernet, 
-   two USB 3.0 ports and two USB 2.0 ports, 
-   dual monitor support (up to 4Kp60), 
-   hardware video decode at up to 4Kp60, 
-   up to 8GB of RAM

## Raspberry Pi Zero: 

Here are some of the features of Raspberry Pi Zero:

## Advantages of Raspberry Pi
The advantages of Raspberry Pi are its low cost (~$35), huge processing power in a compact board, many interfaces (HDMI, multiple USB, Ethernet, onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, many GPIOs), supports Linux and Python (making it easy to build applications), readily available examples with community support. 

## Disadvantages of Raspberry Pi
The disadvantages are that it is not suitable for commercial products.  It is also not suitable for AI or video processing usecases that require a very sophisticated onboard GPU.

## Some use cases of Raspberry Pi are:

- **Home automation:** Raspberry Pi can be used to control smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. It can also be used to automate tasks such as watering plants or feeding pets.

- **Media center:** Raspberry Pi can be used as a media center by installing software such as Kodi or Plex. This allows you to stream movies, TV shows, and music from your home network.

- **Retro gaming console:** Raspberry Pi can be used to build a retro gaming console by installing software such as RetroPie. This allows you to play classic games from consoles such as NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis.

- **Robotics:** Raspberry Pi can be used to build robots by connecting it to sensors and motors. This allows you to build robots that can move around and interact with their environment.

- **Smart mirror:** Raspberry Pi can be used to build a smart mirror that displays information such as the weather, news, and calendar events. It can also be used to control smart home devices.

- **Weather station:** Raspberry Pi can be used to build a weather station that measures temperature, humidity, and air pressure. This data can then be displayed on a website or sent to your phone.

## Raspberry Pi vs. Nvidia Jetson Nano:

The biggest difference between Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano is that the Raspberry Pi has a low power VideoCore multimedia processor, and Jetson Nano contains higher performance, more powerful GPUs (graphics processors), which makes it support some functions that Raspberry Pi can’t do. 

Another difference is that the Raspberry Pi has increased versatility in terms of memory. There are four different versions available, ranging from 1GB to 8GB. Generally, the Jetson Nano has 4GB of memory, though there is a 2GB version available.

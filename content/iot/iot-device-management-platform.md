The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big thing.

It's changing the way we live, work, and play. And it's just getting started.

Imagine a world where everything is connected and can communicate with each other. Where your car can talk to your house, your refrigerator can order groceries for you, and your doctor can monitor your health remotely.

That's the world of the IoT. And it's coming sooner than you think.

According to Gartner, the number of IoT devices in use worldwide is expected to reach 25.2 billion by 2030. This growth is being driven by the adoption of IoT technologies in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and transportation.

To manage, monitor and control IoT devices efficiently at scale, you need an IoT device management platform.

## What is an IoT Device Management Platform

An [IoT device management platform](/socketxp-iot-device-management-platform) is a software solution that helps businesses to manage their IoT devices. 

These platforms provide a variety of features, such as device registration and provisioning, [device monitoring](/iot/iot-remote-monitoring) and diagnostics, [device tracking](/iot-asset-tracking), device configuration and [firmware updates](/iot-ota-update), secure device communication, and data collection and analytics.

Example: AWS IoT, Azure IoT, [SocketXP IoT Device Management Platform](/socketxp-iot-device-management-platform/).

## Why you need an IoT Device Management Platform
IoT device management platforms are essential for businesses that are deploying large numbers of IoT devices. These platforms can help businesses to:

{{<image-format src="/assets/img/iot-device-management-platform/need-for-iot-device-management.jpg" alt="Need for IoT Remote Access and Device Management Platform"  >}}


- **Improve efficiency:** IoT device management platforms can automate many of the tasks involved in managing IoT devices, such as device registration, provisioning, and configuration. This can free up IT staff to focus on other tasks.

- **Reduce costs:** IoT device management platforms can help businesses to reduce the costs associated with managing IoT devices. For example, these platforms can help businesses to reduce the number of support tickets they receive and to identify and resolve problems with devices before they cause downtime.

- **Improve security:** IoT device management platforms can help businesses to improve the security of their IoT devices. These platforms can help businesses to deploy security patches, to monitor devices for suspicious activity, and to isolate and quarantine compromised devices.

- **Simplify Maintenance:**
Maintaining the device in good health ensures its longevity and improves the bottom line for your business. Administrators of connected devices prefer to proactively identify imminent problems, say for example a device battery about to die or a disk usage about to reach its full capacity, and fix them before they occur.

Managing multiple IoT devices is akin to the IT support function managing computers across the branch offices of an enterprise from the headquarters. Unlike computer systems in an office setting, IoT devices are deployed in extreme working environments with varying temperatures, humidity, pressure, and network connectivity.

Handling the upkeep through these vagaries needs a comprehensive approach, at the heart of which must be an IoT device management solution.


## Key Features of IoT Device Management Platforms
Here is a more detailed look at some of the key features of [IoT device management platforms](/socketxp-iot-device-management-platform/):

{{<image-format src="/assets/img/iot-device-management-platform/what-iot-device-management-platform.jpg" alt="What is IoT Remote Access and Device Management Platform"  >}}


### Device registration and provisioning: 
This feature allows you to register your IoT devices with the platform and to provision them with the necessary credentials and configuration settings. This process can be done manually or automatically, depending on the platform.

For example, you could use an IoT device management platform to automatically register and provision all of the new devices that are connected to your network. This would save you a lot of time and effort, and it would also help to ensure that all of your devices are properly configured.

### Device monitoring and diagnostics: 

This feature allows you to [remotely monitor the performance of your IoT devices](/iot/iot-remote-monitoring) and to identify and resolve any problems that may occur. This can be done by collecting data from the devices, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.

For example, you could use an [IoT device management platform](/socketxp-iot-device-management-platform) to monitor the temperature of your smart thermostats. If a thermostat starts to overheat, the platform could send you an alert so that you can take action to prevent damage.

### Device configuration and firmware updates: 

This feature allows you to remotely configure your IoT devices and to deploy firmware updates. This can be useful for changing device settings, such as the network configuration or the operating mode. It can also be used to deploy security patches and new features.

For example, you could use an [IoT device management platform](/socketxp-iot-device-management-platform/) to remotely update the firmware on all of your security cameras. This would ensure that your cameras are always running the latest security patches.


### Secure device communication: 

This feature helps to protect your IoT devices and data from cyberattacks. It can include features such as encryption, authentication, and authorization.

For example, an IoT device management platform might use encryption to protect the data that is transmitted between your devices and the cloud. This would help to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your data.

### Data collection and analytics: 

This feature allows you to collect data from your IoT devices and to analyze it to gain insights into your business. This data can be used to improve your products and services, to optimize your operations, and to make better decisions.

For example, you could use an IoT device management platform to collect data from your smart thermostats to learn more about how your customers are using them. This data could be used to develop new features or to create more targeted marketing campaigns.

## IoT Device Remote Access
Providing [secure remote access to IoT devices over the internet](/iot-remote-access) is one of the critical functions of an IoT device management platform. IoT device admins and support teams need remote access to IoT devices to configure, debug and manage them. There are multiple ways to remote access IoT devices.

### IoT SSH Remote Access
[IoT SSH remote access](/iot/how-to-remote-access-iot-ssh-over-the-internet) provision allows you to directly connect to IoT or embedded Linux devices that may even be behind a NAT router or a firewall and send commands from a web portal. The data is sent through an encrypted SSH tunnel.  

Remote SSH sessions are extremly useful in executing commands or scripts remotely, restarting services, viewing device logs, updating device configuration, upgrade software or apply patches.

<h2 id="how-socketxp-supports-iot-asset-tracking">How SocketXP Supports IoT Asset Tracking:</h2>
<p>SocketXP offers a comprehensive platform for IoT asset tracking, providing tools for real-time location tracking on a map.</p>
<p>SocketXP&rsquo;s asset tracking feature leverages internet-connected devices to monitor the location of physical assets. By attaching tracking devices (smart devices with a GPS unit) to assets, businesses can collect and transmit data to the SocketXP cloud gateway1. The SocketXP agent supports asset tracking and can track and transmit the location of remote devices. Users can view their devices on a map using the SocketXP web portal&rsquo;s MapView feature1.</p>
<p>SocketXP also provides an API to retrieve the current geographic location (geolocation coordinates) of devices. If your IoT device has a built-in GPS unit, you can use a custom app to read the GPS coordinates and write them to a file named geolocation.json in the device. The SocketXP agent will periodically read the longitude and latitude values from this file and transmit the information to the SocketXP Cloud Gateway1.</p>
<p>For devices without a built-in GPS unit, SocketXP can use the Google GeoLocation API to retrieve geolocation information. By registering with the Google GeoLocation service and obtaining an API key, businesses can input the API key into the SocketXP agent configuration to enable asset tracking1.</p>
<p>For step-by-step guides on setting up and managing IoT asset tracking, refer to the comprehensive documentation available on <a href="https://docs.socketxp.com/guide/api-reference-guide/api-asset-tracking/">SocketXP Asset Tracking Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>IoT asset tracking is a powerful tool for businesses looking to optimize their operations, reduce losses, and enhance efficiency. By leveraging SocketXP’s platform, companies can achieve their asset tracking goals and drive business success. Explore the detailed documentation on SocketXP’s website for more information and best practices.</p>
